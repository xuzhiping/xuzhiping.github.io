Dr. Zhiping Xu received his B.S. (2002) and Ph.D (2007) from Tsinghua University. After working at Rice University (2007-2008) and MIT (2008-2010), he returned to Tsinghua in 2010 and is now a Professor of Engineering Mechanics. His research interests include the physics of synthetic materials and living systems in general. Currently his work is focused on the microstructural complexity and evolution of matter.
